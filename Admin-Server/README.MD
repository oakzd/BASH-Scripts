# This script will show you how to run command(s) against remote servers

To give a breakdown of the project

1. Ability to specify your own file instead of default.
2. DRYRUN mode where you can preview the commands that will run.
3. Enable sudo mode when running commands against servers.
4. Enable verbose mode to identify which server is being executed on.
5. Provides usage statment to show how script is properly used.
6. Will inform user if command(s) was not able to run.

## Why is this needed?

* If you have a large environment that you commands on this will make it simplier then loggin into each one.
* It will save time if there are servers that are offline and require troubleshooting.
* Prvent issues from happening when using DRYRUN mode.

## Who can use this?

* System Admins and System Architects who have large environments to maintain.
